# Getting Started with Create React App
# Threat Intel Workshop App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Authentication System

This application includes a user authentication system that uses AWS DynamoDB to store user credentials. Users can register for an account and log in to access the workshop content.

### Setting Up DynamoDB

1. Configure your AWS credentials in the `.env` file:
   ```
   REACT_APP_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
   REACT_APP_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
   REACT_APP_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   ```

2. Create the DynamoDB table by running:
   ```
   npm run setup-db
   ```

### AWS Lambda Deployment Notes

When deploying to AWS Lambda, all file operations must use the `/tmp` directory as the file system is read-only elsewhere. Set the following environment variables:

```
HOME=/tmp
DSPY_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/dspy_cache
LITELLM_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/litellm_cache
JOBLIB_TEMP_FOLDER=/tmp/joblib_cache
TRANSFORMERS_CACHE=/tmp/transformers_cache
HF_HOME=/tmp/hf_home
XDG_CACHE_HOME=/tmp/xdg_cache
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/tmp/playwright
NLTK_DATA=/tmp/nltk_data
CRAWL4AI_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/crawl4ai_cache
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
